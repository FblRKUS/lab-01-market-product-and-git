## Roles and responsibilities

1. **Back-end engineer** — designs, implements, and maintains server-side logic and APIs. Writes and optimizes core service code, handles data processing pipelines, and ensures services meet performance and reliability requirements.

2. **Security engineer** — identifies and mitigates security vulnerabilities across the system. Designs and reviews cryptographic protocols (e.g., MTProto), conducts security audits, and ensures compliance with data protection standards.

3. **DevOps / SRE** — manages deployment pipelines, infrastructure provisioning, and monitoring. Ensures high availability and low latency of services, handles incident response, and automates operational tasks such as scaling and failover.

4. **DBA / Database engineer** — designs and maintains database schemas, sharding strategies, and replication setups. Optimizes query performance, manages backups and disaster recovery, and monitors database health and capacity.

5. **QA engineer** — develops and executes test plans (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure software quality. Automates regression testing, reports and tracks defects, and validates that features meet functional and non-functional requirements.

## Common skills across roles

- **Version control:** Git, branching strategies, code review workflows
- **Networking fundamentals:** TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket, TLS
- **Linux/Unix administration:** command line, process management, log analysis
- **Containerization & orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD:** building and maintaining automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
- **Monitoring & observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, distributed tracing
- **Databases:** SQL and NoSQL fundamentals, understanding of replication and sharding
- **Security basics:** authentication/authorization patterns, encryption, secure coding practices
- **Communication & collaboration:** working in cross-functional teams, writing technical documentation
