## Roles and responsibilities

1. **Back-end engineer** — designs, implements, and maintains server-side logic and APIs. Writes and optimizes core service code, handles data processing pipelines, and ensures services meet performance and reliability requirements.

2. **Security engineer** — identifies and mitigates security vulnerabilities across the system. Designs and reviews cryptographic protocols (e.g., MTProto), conducts security audits, and ensures compliance with data protection standards.

3. **DevOps / SRE** — manages deployment pipelines, infrastructure provisioning, and monitoring. Ensures high availability and low latency of services, handles incident response, and automates operational tasks such as scaling and failover.

4. **DBA / Database engineer** — designs and maintains database schemas, sharding strategies, and replication setups. Optimizes query performance, manages backups and disaster recovery, and monitors database health and capacity.

5. **QA engineer** — develops and executes test plans (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure software quality. Automates regression testing, reports and tracks defects, and validates that features meet functional and non-functional requirements.

## Common skills across roles

- **Programming languages:** proficiency in at least one systems or back-end language (C/C++, Go, Java, Python)
- **Version control:** Git, branching strategies, code review workflows
- **Networking fundamentals:** TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket, TLS
- **Linux/Unix administration:** command line, process management, log analysis
- **Containerization & orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD:** building and maintaining automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
- **Monitoring & observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, distributed tracing
- **Databases:** SQL and NoSQL fundamentals, understanding of replication and sharding
- **Security basics:** authentication/authorization patterns, encryption, secure coding practices
- **Communication & collaboration:** working in cross-functional teams, writing technical documentation

## Personal reflection

I chose the Backend Developer role because I enjoy working with server-side logic, databases, and building systems that handle data behind the scenes. I find it more satisfying to design APIs and services than to work on visual interfaces. Looking at the job postings, I can see that my current skills in Python, relational databases, Docker, and basic API development give me a reasonable starting point. However, the market clearly demands deeper knowledge in areas like testing, CI/CD pipelines, and architectural patterns — all of which I currently lack. Most postings also expect familiarity with frameworks like FastAPI or Django at a practical level, not just theoretical understanding. This semester, I would like to focus on two key skills: **testing** and **CI/CD**. Testing is fundamental to writing reliable code and is mentioned or implied in almost every posting. CI/CD is essential for modern development workflows and would help me understand how code goes from a local machine to production. Developing these two skills would make me significantly more competitive on the job market and more effective as a team member.
